# Cosmic Route Planner: A Journey into AI and Planetary Exploration

In the ever-expanding world of artificial intelligence, one of the most fascinating aspects is its practical application in solving real-world problems. As part of my journey in the field of AI, I embarked on a project that combined the thrill of space exploration with the power of genetic algorithms. This project, the Cosmic Route Planner, allowed me to apply AI principles learned in my "Artificial Intelligence for Games" course on Udemy, and the experience was nothing short of exhilarating.

## Introduction

The repository I created contains the foundational code for the Cosmic Route Planner, which serves as the starting point for a much larger endeavor. The project aims to solve a challenging problem: finding the shortest route to visit all the planets in our solar system, with the constraint of visiting each planet at least once. While this problem may not have immediate practical implications for space exploration, it serves as a valuable exercise in AI optimization techniques and paves the way for more complex routing problems in various domains.

## Learning AI with Udemy

My journey began with the "Artificial Intelligence for Games" course on Udemy, and I must say that the experience was quite interesting. The course provided a solid foundation in AI, covering topics such as search algorithms, genetic algorithms, neural networks, and more. It was during the section on genetic algorithms that I got the inspiration to work on the Cosmic Route Planner. Genetic algorithms, with their ability to evolve solutions to complex problems, seemed like the perfect tool to tackle the interplanetary route optimization challenge.

## Implementation and Development

The process of implementing the Cosmic Route Planner was both challenging and rewarding. I started by defining the problem and designing the genetic algorithm to find the optimal route. The genetic algorithm utilized concepts of natural selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation to evolve a population of routes. It was fascinating to see how the algorithm improved the routes over generations, converging towards the shortest path that covered all planets efficiently.

What I loved most about this project was the opportunity to learn by doing. Implementing the genetic algorithm from scratch, testing it, and fine-tuning the parameters were valuable experiences that deepened my understanding of AI. It allowed me to appreciate the intricacies of the genetic algorithm and how it can be applied to various optimization problems.

## A Source of Inspiration

More than just a technical exercise, this project acted as a source of inspiration. The journey into AI, particularly through genetic algorithms, opened my eyes to the depth and potential of artificial intelligence. I realized that AI is not just about building smarter machines but also about harnessing the power of data and algorithms to address complex issues. It has the potential to make a significant impact on humanity by solving problems that were once deemed insurmountable.

## The Power of AI

As I delved into this project, I couldn't help but wonder about the broader applications of AI in solving humanity's challenges. From healthcare and climate change to transportation and education, the possibilities are limitless. AI's ability to optimize and innovate is a driving force for positive change.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Cosmic Route Planner project, born from my "Artificial Intelligence for Games" course, was an exciting endeavor that showcased the practical side
